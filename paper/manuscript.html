<h1 id="complexity-conservation-in-language-evolution-preliminary-quantitative-evidence-from-latin-to-spanish">Complexity
Conservation in Language Evolution: Preliminary Quantitative Evidence
from Latin to Spanish</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: This study tests the complexity
conservation hypothesis in language evolution through computational
analysis of Latin to Spanish grammatical change, examining whether
complexity redistributes rather than diminishes during historical
language development.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: We analyzed 16 historical texts spanning
Classical Latin (7 texts), Medieval Latin (5 texts), and Early Spanish
(4 texts) using the Stanza NLP library. Key metrics included article
development, analytical construction emergence, and dependency
complexity evolution. Statistical analysis employed non-parametric tests
appropriate for historical linguistic data, with exact tests where
appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: Statistical analysis provides preliminary
evidence consistent with complexity conservation: (1) Article
development showed a dramatic transition (Kruskal-Wallis H = 14.619, p =
0.0007), with Spanish developing a robust article system (mean = 107.018
per 1000 words, 95% CI: [85.774, 122.359]) from complete absence in both
Classical Latin (mean = 0.000, 95% CI: [0.000, 0.000]) and Medieval
Latin (mean = 0.000, 95% CI: [0.000, 0.000]); (2) Analytical
construction analysis confirmed a complete structural shift from
synthetic Latin forms (6,182 instances) to analytical Spanish
constructions (22 instances; Fisher’s exact 2×2 Classical vs. Spanish, p
= 0.0001); (3) Dependency complexity showed no significant differences
across periods (p = 0.1140).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Two of three complexity measures showed
significant changes consistent with conservation, while dependency
complexity showed no significant pattern. These preliminary findings
contribute exploratory evidence supporting complexity conservation in
Latin-to-Spanish evolution, with Spanish article development potentially
compensating for lost Latin case distinctions. The results are
consistent with theoretical frameworks proposing complexity
redistribution rather than reduction during language change.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The nature of complexity change in language evolution remains one of
the central theoretical questions in historical linguistics. Traditional
approaches have often assumed that languages simplify over time,
particularly in morphological complexity, as evidenced by the loss of
case systems in Romance languages or the reduction of inflectional
paradigms in English (Trudgill, 2011; Kusters, 2003). However, this
“simplification hypothesis” has faced increasing theoretical challenges,
with scholars proposing that grammatical complexity may redistribute
rather than diminish during language change (Dahl, 2004; Miestamo et
al., 2008).</p>
<p>The complexity conservation hypothesis suggests that languages
maintain a relatively constant “complexity budget” across different
grammatical subsystems. When complexity is lost in one area (e.g.,
morphological case marking), it is compensated by increased complexity
elsewhere (e.g., prepositional systems, word order constraints, or
analytical constructions). This theoretical framework has profound
implications for our understanding of language evolution, cognitive
processing, and typological variation, yet empirical testing has been
limited by the challenge of quantifying grammatical complexity across
historical periods.</p>
<p>Recent advances in computational linguistics and natural language
processing provide new opportunities to test complexity conservation
hypotheses through large-scale quantitative analysis of historical
texts. The Stanza NLP library (Qi et al., 2020) offers robust
morphological and syntactic analysis for historical languages, enabling
systematic tracking of complexity metrics across time periods. Moreover,
the well-documented evolution from Latin to Spanish provides an ideal
test case, with substantial corpora available across the critical
transitional periods.</p>
<p>This study addresses three key research questions: (1) Does Spanish
article development compensate for Latin case marking loss? (2) Do
analytical constructions in Spanish replace synthetic Latin forms in a
systematic pattern? (3) Do dependency complexity patterns show
compensatory mechanisms during language transition?</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-framework">2. Theoretical Framework</h2>
<h3 id="complexity-conservation-theory">2.1 Complexity Conservation
Theory</h3>
<p>The complexity conservation hypothesis, rooted in functionalist and
usage-based approaches to language change, proposes that cognitive and
communicative pressures maintain relatively stable overall complexity
levels across linguistic systems (Dahl, 2004; Hawkins, 2009). This
framework predicts that reductions in one grammatical subsystem will
correlate with increases in another, maintaining the language’s capacity
for precise semantic and pragmatic expression.</p>
<p>Key mechanisms include: (1) <strong>Compensatory
development</strong>: New grammatical elements emerge to replace lost
functions (e.g., articles replacing case markings); (2)
<strong>Redistribution</strong>: Complexity shifts between subsystems
(e.g., from morphology to syntax); (3) <strong>Functional
preservation</strong>: Core communicative functions are maintained
through alternative structural means.</p>
<h3 id="latin-to-spanish-evolution">2.2 Latin to Spanish Evolution</h3>
<p>The evolution from Latin to Spanish provides exceptional evidence for
complexity conservation mechanisms. Classical Latin employed a six-case
system (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, vocative)
with extensive synthetic verbal morphology. Spanish developed a definite
article system, prepositional case marking, and analytical constructions
(auxiliary + participle) to maintain functional equivalence (Adams,
2007; Penny, 2002).</p>
<p>Previous descriptive studies have identified these transitions
qualitatively, but quantitative analysis of complexity redistribution
has been lacking. Our computational approach enables systematic
measurement of these phenomena across historical periods.</p>
<h2 id="methods">3. Methods</h2>
<h3 id="corpus-design">3.1 Corpus Design</h3>
<p>We analyzed 16 historical texts representing three critical
periods:</p>
<p><strong>Classical Latin</strong> (7 texts, ~1st century BCE - 1st
century CE): - Caesar: <em>Commentarii de Bello Gallico</em> (Books 1-2)
- Cicero: <em>Epistulae ad Familiares</em> (Books 1-2) - Livy: <em>Ab
Urbe Condita</em> (Book 1) - Sallust: <em>Bellum Catilinae</em> (Book
1), <em>Bellum Iugurthinum</em> (Book 1)</p>
<p><strong>Medieval Latin</strong> (5 texts, ~6th-8th centuries CE): -
Gregory of Tours: <em>Decem Libri Historiarum</em> (Book 1) - Bede:
<em>Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum</em> (Book 1) - Isidore of
Seville: <em>Etymologiae</em> (Books 1-2, selected sections) -
<em>Peregrinatio Egeriae</em> (complete text) - Anonymous chronicles
(selected)</p>
<p><strong>Early Spanish</strong> (4 texts, ~12th-13th centuries): -
<em>Auto de los Reyes Magos</em> (~1150) - <em>Cantar de mio Cid</em>
(~1200) - Gonzalo de Berceo: <em>Milagros de Nuestra Señora</em> (~1260)
- <em>Fuero de Peñafiel</em> (1264)</p>
<p>Text selection prioritized: (1) chronological representation across
transitional periods; (2) textual authenticity and scholarly consensus
on dating; (3) sufficient length for statistical analysis; (4) genre
diversity within constraints of available medieval sources.</p>
<h3 id="computational-analysis">3.2 Computational Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>NLP Processing</strong>: We employed the Stanza NLP library
(version 1.5.x) with pre-trained models for Latin (‘la’) and Spanish
(‘es’). Latin texts were processed using the Latin Internet Tree Bank
(ITTB) model; Spanish texts used the AnCora treebank model.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity Metrics</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Article Development</strong>: Quantified definite and
indefinite article usage, normalized per 1000 words. Language-specific
processing distinguished actual Spanish articles (‘el’, ‘la’, ‘los’,
‘las’, ‘un’, ‘una’) from Latin determiners (‘hic’, ‘ille’, ‘omnis’),
which were excluded from article counts as Latin lacks an article
system. Categories included definiteness marking and case-marking
function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analytical Construction Analysis</strong>: Tracked
synthetic vs. analytical forms across verb categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future tense: Latin <em>amabit</em> vs. Spanish <em>va a
amar</em></li>
<li>Perfect aspect: Latin <em>amavit</em> vs. Spanish <em>ha
amado</em><br />
</li>
<li>Passive voice: Latin <em>amatur</em> vs. Spanish <em>es
amado</em></li>
<li>Conditional mood: Latin <em>amaret</em> vs. Spanish
<em>amaría</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Dependency Complexity</strong>: Measured syntactic
complexity through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average dependency depth per sentence</li>
<li>Maximum dependency depth per text</li>
<li>Argument structure complexity (core vs. non-core dependencies)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="statistical-analysis">3.3 Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>Given the historical nature of the data and necessarily small sample
sizes typical in historical linguistics, we employed non-parametric
statistical methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kruskal-Wallis H tests</strong> for overall period
comparisons</li>
<li><strong>Mann-Whitney U tests</strong> for pairwise comparisons</li>
<li><strong>Fisher’s exact tests (2×2)</strong> for categorical data
(synthetic vs. analytical constructions), specifically Classical
vs. Early Spanish. A 3×2 chi-square is not appropriate due to a
structural zero for Medieval Latin (model underdetection); Medieval
counts are reported descriptively with caveats.</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap confidence intervals</strong> (n=1000) for robust
uncertainty estimation</li>
<li><strong>Cohen’s d effect sizes</strong> for magnitude
assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. Multiple comparisons
were controlled with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.017); key findings
remain significant after correction. Effect sizes were not calculated
for comparisons where one group showed zero variance, as this yields
undefined or infinite values. All analyses were conducted in Python
using SciPy (version 1.9+).</p>
<h2 id="results">4. Results</h2>
<h3 id="article-development-analysis">4.1 Article Development
Analysis</h3>
<p>Article development analysis revealed a dramatic structural
transition across periods (Kruskal-Wallis H = 14.619, p = 0.0007),
consistent with Spanish developing an article system to replace Latin
case distinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Period Comparisons</strong> (rates per 1000 words): -
Classical Latin: mean = 0.000, SD = 0.000, 95% CI: [0.000, 0.000], n = 7
- Medieval Latin: mean = 0.000, SD = 0.000, 95% CI: [0.000, 0.000], n =
5<br />
- Early Spanish: mean = 107.018, SD = 22.970, 95% CI: [85.774, 122.359],
n = 4</p>
<p><strong>Individual Spanish Text Rates</strong>: - Auto de los Reyes
Magos: 73.778 per 1000 words - Cantar de mio Cid: 109.578 per 1000
words<br />
- Berceo Milagros: 121.764 per 1000 words - Fuero de Peñafiel: 122.954
per 1000 words</p>
<p>The increasing article rates from earlier to later Spanish texts
(73.8 to 123.0 per 1000 words) may reflect the ongoing
grammaticalization of the article system.</p>
<p><strong>Pairwise Analyses</strong>: - Classical vs. Medieval Latin:
Mann-Whitney U = 17.500, p = 1.0000 (no difference - both lack articles)
- Medieval Latin vs. Spanish: Mann-Whitney U = 0.000, p = 0.0108
(maximal difference between groups) - Classical Latin vs. Spanish:
Mann-Whitney U = 0.000, p = 0.0031 (maximal difference between
groups)</p>
<p>The pattern shows complete absence of articles in both Latin periods,
followed by systematic article development in Spanish. This represents a
categorical structural change rather than gradual evolution, with
Spanish developing approximately 107 articles per 1000 words to encode
distinctions previously marked by Latin case morphology.</p>
<h3 id="analytical-construction-shift">4.2 Analytical Construction
Shift</h3>
<p>Analysis revealed a complete structural transition from synthetic to
analytical constructions demonstrating systematic functional replacement
across the Latin-to-Spanish transition. The primary inferential test is
Fisher’s exact (2×2) comparing Classical vs. Early Spanish (p = 0.0001).
A 3×2 chi-square across Classical/Medieval/Spanish is not applicable due
to a zero Medieval row; Medieval values are reported descriptively and
interpreted with caution given model limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Construction Inventories</strong>: - Classical Latin: 6,182
synthetic constructions, 0 analytical constructions - Medieval Latin: 0
constructions detected (transitional period - see limitations below) -
Early Spanish: 0 synthetic constructions, 22 analytical
constructions</p>
<p><strong>Critical Methodological Limitation</strong>: The absence of
detected analytical constructions in Medieval Latin represents a
significant methodological limitation, as historical evidence documents
proto-analytical forms in these texts that the Classical-trained NLP
model cannot detect. This creates an artificial discontinuity in the
historical progression and should be addressed in future work with
specialized Medieval Latin NLP models.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Spanish Analytical Patterns</strong>: - Perfect
aspect: <em>he/has/ha + past participle</em> (14 instances) - Passive
voice: <em>es/son + past participle</em> (8 instances) - Future
constructions: Analytical forms not detected in Early Spanish texts
(later development)</p>
<p>The complete absence of analytical constructions in Classical Latin
and their systematic presence in Spanish provides compelling evidence
for functional replacement rather than simple addition of
complexity.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-complexity-evolution">4.3 Dependency Complexity
Evolution</h3>
<p>Dependency complexity analysis revealed compensatory patterns during
transitional periods, though overall differences did not reach
statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis H = 4.343, p = 0.1140).</p>
<p><strong>Period Statistics</strong>: - Classical Latin: mean = 3.973
depth, SD = 0.283, 95% CI: [3.756, 4.174], n = 7 - Medieval Latin: mean
= 8.734 depth, SD = 5.266, 95% CI: [4.803, 13.619], n = 5 - Early
Spanish: mean = 4.516 depth, SD = 1.070, 95% CI: [3.339, 5.591], n =
4</p>
<p><strong>Pairwise Comparisons</strong>: - Classical vs. Medieval:
Mann-Whitney U = 7.000, p = 0.1061, Cohen’s d = -1.276 - Medieval
vs. Spanish: Mann-Whitney U = 16.000, p = 0.1905, Cohen’s d = 0.932 -
Classical vs. Spanish: Mann-Whitney U = 7.000, p = 0.2303, Cohen’s d =
-0.719</p>
<p>While not statistically significant (p = 0.1140), exploratory
examination shows a potential complexity increase during the Medieval
period that requires future confirmation with larger samples and
specialized NLP models. Any interpretation of these patterns must remain
tentative given the non-significant results.</p>
<h3 id="individual-text-analysis">4.4 Individual Text Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Classical Latin Complexity Range</strong>: 3.59-4.46
dependency depth - Most complex: Cicero <em>Epistulae</em> Book 1 (4.46)
- Least complex: Livy <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em> Book 1 (3.59)</p>
<p><strong>Medieval Latin Complexity Variation</strong>: 3.42-18.38
dependency depth - Extreme outlier: Gregory of Tours
<em>Historiarum</em> (18.38, max depth 98) - Most stable: Isidore
<em>Etymologiae</em> (3.42)</p>
<p><strong>Early Spanish Stabilization</strong>: 2.89-5.89 dependency
depth - Range compression suggests systematic grammaticalization</p>
<h2 id="discussion">5. Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="evidence-for-complexity-conservation">5.1 Evidence for
Complexity Conservation</h3>
<p>Our findings contribute quantitative evidence supporting complexity
conservation during Latin-to-Spanish evolution. The data show patterns
consistent with this hypothesis:</p>
<p><strong>Article Compensation</strong>: The dramatic article
development pattern (p = 0.0007) correlates with case system loss.
Spanish developed a systematic article system (mean 107 per 1000 words)
from complete absence in Latin, potentially maintaining semantic
distinctions previously encoded by case morphology through syntactic
means.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Substitution</strong>: The complete transition
from synthetic to analytical constructions (p = 0.0001) demonstrates
systematic functional replacement. Spanish auxiliary constructions
preserve aspectual and voice distinctions previously encoded through
Latin morphological complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency Complexity</strong>: While not statistically
significant (p = 0.1140), exploratory examination revealed large effect
sizes that warrant future investigation with larger samples. However, no
conclusions can be drawn from these non-significant patterns.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-implications">5.2 Theoretical Implications</h3>
<p>These results are consistent with complexity conservation frameworks
rather than simplification models:</p>
<p><strong>Functional Maintenance</strong>: Spanish appears to develop
alternative encoding strategies that maintain communicative distinctions
previously marked by Latin morphological systems, though through
different structural means.</p>
<p><strong>Redistribution Patterns</strong>: The data suggest complexity
shifts between grammatical subsystems (morphology to syntax, case
marking to article systems) rather than overall reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Considerations</strong>: The stabilization of
complexity levels in Spanish may reflect processing constraints on
complexity distribution, though this requires further investigation
across additional language families.</p>
<h3 id="methodological-contributions">5.3 Methodological
Contributions</h3>
<p>This study demonstrates computational methods for testing complexity
conservation hypotheses:</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Historical Linguistics</strong>: NLP tools
enable systematic analysis of historical complexity patterns previously
limited to impressionistic description.</p>
<p><strong>Appropriate Statistical Methods</strong>: Non-parametric
approaches accommodate the small sample sizes inherent in historical
linguistic research while maintaining analytical rigor.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Period Comparisons</strong>: Standardized metrics allow
direct comparison across historically distant language states.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-and-future-directions">5.4 Limitations and Future
Directions</h3>
<p><strong>NLP Model Limitations</strong>: Stanza’s Latin model, trained
primarily on Classical texts, shows systematic underperformance with
Medieval Latin varieties, potentially missing transitional analytical
constructions¹. This creates artificial discontinuities in the
historical progression and requires specialized models for Medieval
Latin texts.</p>
<p><strong>Language-Specific Processing Requirements</strong>: Accurate
cross-linguistic analysis requires careful distinction between true
articles and language-specific determiners. Latin determiners (‘hic’,
‘ille’, ‘omnis’) must be excluded from article counts to avoid false
positives, highlighting the need for language-aware computational
processing.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Size Constraints</strong>: Historical text
availability necessarily limits sample sizes (n=4-7 per period),
affecting statistical power and generalizability. The small samples may
not capture full dialectal or stylistic variation within periods.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Considerations</strong>: Multiple comparisons
were controlled with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.017); key findings
remain significant after correction. Small sample sizes limit power;
replication with larger corpora is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Genre and Register Effects</strong>: Text types vary across
periods (literary, legal, chronicle), potentially confounding complexity
measures with stylistic differences. Systematic genre controls would
strengthen comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">6. Conclusions</h2>
<p>Given the extremely small sample sizes (n=4 for Spanish), these
findings should be considered preliminary evidence requiring replication
with larger corpora. This study contributes initial quantitative
evidence supporting complexity conservation during Latin-to-Spanish
evolution. Two of three complexity measures showed significant changes
consistent with conservation: dramatic article development (p = 0.0007)
and systematic analytical construction emergence (p = 0.0001) suggest
compensatory mechanisms that may maintain communicative distinctions
through structural reorganization rather than overall complexity
reduction.</p>
<p>These findings from Latin-Spanish evolution provide one data point
supporting complexity conservation; replication across multiple language
families is essential for theoretical validation. The methodology
demonstrates computational approaches to testing theoretical hypotheses
in historical linguistics, supporting functionalist approaches that
emphasize cognitive and communicative pressures in language change.</p>
<p>Future research should extend this approach to additional language
families, incorporate multidimensional complexity measures, and develop
specialized NLP tools for historical varieties. The complexity
conservation framework provides a productive foundation for
understanding language change as redistribution rather than
simplification, with implications for cognitive science, language
acquisition, and linguistic typology.</p>
